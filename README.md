# Crypto

This is hopefully going to become a well documented crypto library. Right now its just a bunch of python code dumped into a directory. Documentation? Whats that?

## Supported Ciphers
### Substitution Ciphers
1. Caesar
2. Substitution
3. Vignere
4. Playfair
### Transposition Ciphers
4. Transposition
### Mathematical Ciphers
5. Affine (Modular Arithmetic)
6. Hill (Matrix Multiplication)
### Combination Ciphers
7. ADFGVX (Substitution + Transposition)

## Use
All supported ciphers have cipher.encode() and cipher.decode(). However, arguments and other methods vary, simply due to the nature of the different ciphers.
